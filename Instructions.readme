Autopilot script for aerodynamic fixed wing aircraft
By DFPercush 2022
		
If run without any arguments: toggles autopilot on/off.
Will maintain level flight at current heading, altitude, and speed.
		
If run with an argument of heading, altitude, speed...
Example:
	90, 1500, 60
Will fly due east, at 1500 m above sea level (or surface, depending on mode) at 60 m/s
... or, using the keywords below, set one of those values by itself,
leaving the others unchanged.

Examples:
	spd 75    -- set speed to 75 m/s
	alt 2500  -- set altitude to 2500 m
	hdg 180   -- set heading to 180 (fly south)
	alt +100  -- Increase altitude by 100 m
	alt=-100  -- Set altitude to -100 m.
	             Useful for certain modded planets where sea
				 level is very high.
	spd -5    -- Decrease speed by 5 m/s

Values will be remembered until a "stop" command is issued.
Switching to manual nav mode will remember speed and altitude in case of target selection.

Other commands:
	stop
		Disables script and resets all overrides.
	cruise
		Set cruise control, manage speed only.
	response (=/+/-)(number)
		Adjusts the general responsiveness of the controls.
		Used to fine tune the handling. If things are too twitchy,
		or there are oscillations, try decreasing it. If things are
		too sluggish, try increasing it.
	pitchresponse (=/+/-)(number)
		Adjusts the gyro response specifically in the pitch axis.
	rollresponse (=/+/-)(number)
		Adjusts the gyro response specifically in the roll axis.
	nav
		manual navigation. Runs the display but no autopilot.
	sea
		Switch to sea level altitude.
	surf
		Switch to surface altitude.
	altmode
		Toggle between sea and surf mode
	target
		Designates a location or object to fly over and engages autopilot.
		Requires a forward facing camera. Point the camera at
		your target, then use a hotbar to call this argument.
	target cancel
		Cancels target lock but maintains autopilot.
	target once
		Acquire target for a single pass, target will cancel after flyover.
		Aim at the sky to set mode without acquiring a target.
	target loop (distance)
		Acquire target and continue to loop back around after flying (distance) past target.
		Aim at the sky to set mode without acquiring a target.
	loop (distance)
		Set the distance to fly past target before looping back.
	target circle (left|right) (radius)
		Enter a circle pattern around target. Target will be to your left or right as specified.
	radius (distance)
		Set the target circle radius without (re-)targeting anything.
	drop
		Drop a bomb
		See config below and define the list of pylons and what action to take.
	drop all
		Begin carpet bombing drop sequence.
	dropdelay
		Override the default delay between bomb releases.
	reloaded
		Reset bomb counter.
	route
		Toggle waypoint mode. Requires a remote control block.
		Uses the list of waypoints and flight mode from the remote control block.
		Note: Altitude and speed are determined by current autopilot settings.
		Those values can not be read from the remote control, only the coordinates.
	route clear
		Stops waypoint mode, resets progress to first waypoint, and continues holding current heading.
		Does not modify the list of waypoints in the remote control block.
	route next
	route prev
		Selects the next/previous waypoint.
	test next waypoint
	test route end
		Triggers the block and action specified below for your testing purposes.
		Does not affect current flight mode.
	target land
		Designates a point to lands at, facing the current heading.
	land
		Lands at the first available runway. Requires ILS localizer script.
	land (runway)
		Chooses a specific runway to land at. Requires ILS localizer script.
